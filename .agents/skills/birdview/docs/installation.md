# Install Birdview

[中文](installation.zh.md)

## Multi-agent installation

Use the third-party [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) to select an agent and installation scope:

```sh
npx skills add Qiuner/birdview --skill birdview
npx skills add Qiuner/birdview --skill birdview --agent codex --global --copy --yes
npx skills add Qiuner/birdview --skill birdview --agent claude-code --global --copy --yes
```

Omit `--global` for project scope. These install the current repository version. Use the archive method below for a fixed release. In the destination printed by the installer, run `npm ci` (including development dependencies), then `node scripts/birdview.mjs doctor`. The read-only self-check invokes the installed validation CLI through the installation path, checks its JSON report, and renders the bundled example in memory. It does not exercise every worker CLI or verify agent activation. The installer or agent may require a newer Node.js version than Birdview.

Claude Code also supports manual installation into `~/.claude/skills/birdview` or `<project-root>/.claude/skills/birdview`. Keep the complete bundle as described below. For mode commands, add `--agent claude-code` to write/query `CLAUDE.md`; the default manages `AGENTS.md`.

## DeepSeek Harness

Harness natively discovers `.dsh/skills` and `.agents/skills`. Install the complete bundle without a separate plugin (PowerShell or POSIX shell):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Qiuner/birdview.git "$HOME/.dsh/skills/birdview"
npm --prefix "$HOME/.dsh/skills/birdview" ci
node "$HOME/.dsh/skills/birdview/scripts/birdview.mjs" doctor
```

If `DSH_HOME` is customized, replace `$HOME/.dsh` with that directory. For project scope, use `<project-root>/.dsh/skills/birdview`. An existing `~/.agents/skills/birdview` installation is also discoverable; avoid duplicates. Shared roots can be overridden by `DSH_AGENTS_HOME` or host configuration. Add `--agent deepseek` to mode commands; this manages `AGENTS.md`.

This targets Harness with its filesystem skill provider enabled, checked against [source revision 7a0b768](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/7a0b7682b6690f0aa2d93438c4d526b38ab45777/packages/skill/skill-filesystem/src/index.ts). Follow Harness's own Node.js requirement. This is not an installation into the DeepSeek chat website. Claude Code and Harness live sessions have not been end-to-end tested here; verify activation in a fresh task as described below.

## Manual installation (Codex)

Install Node.js 18 or newer. Download and extract the source archive for the release you want from this repository's GitHub Releases page. Place the complete extracted directory at `~/.agents/skills/birdview` (`~` is your user home). `SKILL.md` must be directly inside `birdview`, not inside another nested directory. Keep the scripts, schemas, assets, references, documentation, examples, package files and license notices together; copying only `SKILL.md` is insufficient.

Install renderer dependencies in that directory:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
npm --prefix "$HOME/.agents/skills/birdview" ci
node "$HOME/.agents/skills/birdview/scripts/validate.mjs" "$HOME/.agents/skills/birdview/examples/architecture.json"
```

```sh
# macOS / Linux
npm --prefix "$HOME/.agents/skills/birdview" ci
node "$HOME/.agents/skills/birdview/scripts/validate.mjs" "$HOME/.agents/skills/birdview/examples/architecture.json"
```

The validator should report `"ok": true`. Start a fresh Codex task in your target project and ask: "Use Birdview to show this project's architecture; do not edit code." Confirm that Codex reads the skill, reports whether an existing map was found, and produces or updates an HTML preview. Successful validation alone does not verify agent activation.

Codex's [official skill documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills) lists `~/.agents/skills` for user skills and `.agents/skills` for repository skills. Codex detects changes automatically; restart it if the skill does not appear. Avoid duplicate installations named `birdview`, including older client-specific skill directories.

## Choose a mode

After installing the bundle, enable persistent foundation rules for each selected project:

```sh
node <skill-root>/scripts/birdview.mjs setup --project <project-root>
```

On the first setup in an environment, run the read-only skill compatibility inventory once:

```sh
node <skill-root>/scripts/birdview.mjs skills audit --project <project-root> --language en --write <project-root>/.birdview/compatibility-audit.json --write-markdown <project-root>/.birdview/compatibility-audit.md
```

It records discovered skill roots, manifests, duplicate names and obvious trigger metadata issues. It does not prove semantic compatibility or disable skills. Read relevant skill bodies before reporting a conflict; rerun after skill or host-rule changes.

Use `--agent claude-code` for Claude Code, `--agent deepseek` for Harness, or the default Codex target. Setup defaults new projects to on-demand and preserves existing auto, on-demand or off. The third-party installer only installs skill files and does not execute this step. In on-demand mode, the foundation still guides coding without loading the skill or requiring a map. Status shows both settings. Use `mode off` to disable both while retaining the installation. These rules require the host to load the project instruction file; verify in a fresh task.

The distributed skill is **on-demand by default**. In Codex, select Birdview through `/skills` or use `$birdview`; in Claude Code, use `/birdview`. Ordinary edits do not trigger it unless auto mode is enabled. Slash commands in other hosts depend on host support. Configure or query using absolute paths:

```sh
node <skill-root>/scripts/birdview.mjs mode on-demand --project <project-root>
node <skill-root>/scripts/birdview.mjs mode --project <project-root>
```

Use `mode auto` to enable automatic activation; `mode on-demand` restores explicit invocation. Select `--agent codex` (default), `--agent claude-code` or `--agent deepseek` consistently for writes and queries. An explicit project setting overrides the default. The CLI manages a block in the target project's `AGENTS.md` (`CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code); it does not configure all projects or synchronize instruction files. See [mode details](../references/modes.md). These are agent instructions, not enforced interception of edits.

## Update or remove

Before updating, preserve any local skill customizations and note the installed version. Replace the installed source with the chosen release and rerun `npm ci`; release defaults can overwrite local customizations. Project mode blocks remain in their projects. Do not keep an old copy inside another scanned skill directory.

After updating, rerun `setup` for each configured project to refresh its foundation while preserving its existing mode. Before removing the installed `birdview` directory, run `node <skill-root>/scripts/birdview.mjs uninstall --project <project-root>` with the same `--agent` for each configured instruction file. This removes only the managed block, not user rules or installed files. If the skill is already gone, remove only the complete block between `<!-- birdview:mode:start -->` and `<!-- birdview:mode:end -->` manually. Project maps and activity records remain. Removing rules alone restores the installed skill's default mode; it is not persistent disabling.

The npm package is private; `npm install -g birdview` is not this project's installation method. For development from a checkout, follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
