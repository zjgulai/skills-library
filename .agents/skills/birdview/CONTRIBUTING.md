# Contribution Guidelines

[中文](CONTRIBUTING.zh.md)

## Development and pull requests

Use Node.js 18 or newer. Fork the repository on GitHub, work in a focused branch in your fork, then open a PR against the upstream default branch. For substantial features, discuss the problem in an issue first. Bug reports should include reproducible steps and sanitized inputs.

```sh
npm ci
npm run check:pr
```

`check:pr` is the single pre-PR checklist. It runs type checking, generated-artifact checks, unit tests, browser tests, tracked-demo regeneration and diff verification, example validation, and documentation checks. Run it after editing and before committing; do not skip browser or generated-demo checks for viewer changes.

For viewer or renderer changes, run `npm run build:demo` and review the tracked demo diff. Verify Chinese and English, desktop and mobile, and the affected interactions. Run `npx playwright install chromium` and `npm run test:browser` for real-browser checks; see the [release checklist](docs/releasing.md). Add regression coverage for behavior changes; describe checks actually run and any remaining limitations in the PR template. Never include private source data or credentials.

CI checks Windows and Linux on Node.js 18 and 24, validates documentation and examples, verifies the tracked demo matches renderer output, and audits clean source archive installations. A Linux Node.js 24 job runs the Chromium viewer and website suites. Contributions are distributed under the repository's [MIT License](LICENSE); preserve [third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES).

## TypeScript migration

Structural contracts are maintained in `src/contracts/models.mts` with TypeBox, which also infers their TypeScript types. `npm run build` emits the runtime modules and regenerates `schemas/*.schema.json`; do not edit those exchange files directly. Ajv remains the runtime validator, with cross-record checks maintained in `src/validate.mts` and emitted to `scripts/validate.mjs`. Migration-only frozen baselines have been removed after acceptance. Contract tests compare the current runtime validators with exported schemas, including mutated inputs and non-mutation checks. `npm run typecheck` also checks narrowing and invalid-type cases, and `check:build` verifies generated schemas. See the [migration work plan](docs/typescript-migration.md) for phase status and remaining work.

The project-mode CLI and HTML renderer are maintained in `src/birdview.mts` and `src/render.mts`; run `npm run build` after editing. Strict TypeScript targets Node.js 18-compatible ESM and emits the existing `scripts/*.mjs` command paths. Distribute generated files with their sources so skill users do not need to compile. CI checks types and compares a temporary clean build with distributed JavaScript. Do not edit generated files directly. The renderer's temporary declaration has been removed; external architecture JSON still requires runtime validation. The browser entry is also TypeScript.

Repository checks are also maintained in `src/check-docs.mts` and `src/check-build.mts`; regenerate their distributed scripts with `npm run build`. `npm test` strictly checks all TypeScript tests and bundles unit tests into the ignored `.test-build/` directory. Tests import distributed modules, so CLI main guards and installation behavior remain intact. `npm run test:browser` runs the compiled browser suites. The committed build checker can verify a clean checkout without first overwriting the artifacts it checks.

Browser implementation is maintained in `src/viewer/main.mts` with explicit imports from `routing.mts` and `i18n.mts`. The entry owns DOM language updates, activity, constraints and guide state; no implicit cross-script globals or textual JavaScript insertion remain. `tsconfig.viewer.json` checks it without Node globals. Pinned esbuild emits the self-contained `assets/viewer.js` and pure ESM modules for tests; `check:build` verifies all outputs. Routing and translation tests cover current behavior without retaining old implementations. Preserve CSS, labels and interaction behavior and verify screenshots when changing this boundary.

## Commit rules

- Do not run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, create branches or rewrite history without an explicit user request.
- Use Conventional Commit titles in the format `type(scope): 中文说明 / English summary`.
- Each commit must contain one logically consistent set of changes. Stage and commit different kinds of changes separately.
- Do not commit local state or temporary build artifacts; follow each directory's `.gitignore`. Distributed JavaScript generated from `src/` under `scripts/`, browser bundle `assets/viewer.js`, and generated exchange schemas under `schemas/` are intentional exceptions and must accompany changes to their TypeScript source. Do not commit `.test-build/`.
- Before committing, inspect the staged diff and exclude unrelated files, generated artifacts, debug output and unexplained formatting.
- When committing only part of a dirty workspace, validate the selected changes in a clean checkout without unrelated files. Run the checks above, including `check:build` and documentation validation, against that exact snapshot. A passing check in the original workspace does not validate the selected commit. After committing, run `check:install` before pushing. Register new generated modules in `build-artifacts.json`; generate documentation hashes from the same snapshot, never from unrelated unfinished work.

## Documentation maintenance

- Pair English `name.md` with Chinese `name.zh.md` in the same directory, with reciprocal links below the first heading. Prefer same-language references; avoid mixed-language prose.
- Keep both versions equivalent, including examples, constraints and limitations. Preserve identifiers, commands, data paths and enums. Edit/review both together, not a summary translation.
- User instructions take precedence. Resolve discrepancies against implementation and authorized requirements, then fix both versions; neither language overrides the other.
- `SKILL.md` alone retains executable frontmatter (`name`, `description`); `SKILL.zh.md` is a reading companion, not another registration.
- Pair new owned Markdown in the root, `references/`, `docs/` and `examples/`. Add new owned directories to the checker; exclude dependencies and generated output.

## Verify and record

```sh
node scripts/check-docs.mjs
```

Checks pairs, language links, local Markdown links and changes since confirmation. `docs/i18n.json` stores SHA-256 hashes with CRLF normalized to LF; hashes cannot verify translation accuracy.

Only after reviewing both versions, refresh and commit the record with the paired files:

```sh
node scripts/check-docs.mjs --update
```

Never refresh hashes merely to silence a failure.

Website and theme startup are maintained in `src/site/main.mts` and `src/viewer/theme.mts`. Their generated distribution artifacts are `docs/site.js` and `assets/theme.js`; commit them with their sources. The renderer embeds the theme startup before styles to preserve theme selection before first paint. `build` and `check:build` cover both artifacts.

`build-artifacts.json` inventories every distributed JS module and exchange schema. `check:build` rejects missing, stale, unlisted and obsolete output. `npm run check:install` audits the committed `HEAD` archive using Git and tar, installs dependencies in a temporary directory, runs doctor and setup/uninstall for all three agents before building, and checks artifact reproduction. Commit first; it intentionally excludes uncommitted work and never uses the checkout’s node_modules.
